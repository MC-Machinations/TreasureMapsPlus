# TreasureMapsPlus
This plugin provides a **solution to the lag spikes** that are **caused by treasure maps searching** for a location to put on a map. 
This plugin just makes those maps provide the **loot table when you right click with the map** in your hand!

Supports maps found in loot tables and villager trades.
